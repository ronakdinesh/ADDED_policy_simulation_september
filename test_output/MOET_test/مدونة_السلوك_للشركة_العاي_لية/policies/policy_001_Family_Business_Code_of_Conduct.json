A key factor \nin the success of a code of conduct is the establishment of a mechanism for \nreporting violations, ensuring the continued operation and growth of the \nFamily Business. \nThe Code of Conduct shall be distributed to all partners, executives, and \nemployees, either in hard copy or electronically, to ensure that everyone in the \nCompany is fully aware of and adheres to the underlying values stipulated \nherein. \nThe importance of adhering to the ethical values enshrined herein shall be \nemphasized at the highest levels of the Family Business, and the Code shall be \npublicly announced upon its issuance. \n\n\n[PAGE 4]\n \n Page 4 of 4 \n \n \nThe Code of Conduct shall be consistently and equitably applied to all partners, \nexecutives, and employees of the Family Business without exception, ensuring \nthe embedding of these ethical values. \n \n3. Updating the Code of Conduct: \nThe Code of Conduct shall be treated as a living document to ensure that it \naddresses all behaviors, ethics, and core values relevant to the Family Business. \nThe Code of Conduct shall be updated regularly to accommodate regulatory \nand legal changes in the business environment. \nAn outdated code of conduct quickly loses its relevance and value. Regular \nupdates to the Family Business Code of Conduct reflect a renewed \ncommitment by all partners, executives, and employees to upholding the \nCompany's core values. \n \nConclusion \n \nAdherence to this Code of Conduct is not merely a legal obligation but also a \nmoral commitment that reflects our values and principles. We expect all \npartners, executives, and employees to abide by these standards and \ncontribute to creating a positive and productive work environment, thereby \nfostering the growth and longevity of the Family Business across generations.",
